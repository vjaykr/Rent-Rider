# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 General Introduction

The transportation industry has witnessed a significant paradigm shift towards shared mobility solutions in recent years. With increasing urbanization, environmental concerns, and the rising cost of vehicle ownership, consumers are increasingly seeking alternative transportation methods that are both economical and environmentally sustainable.

RentRider emerges as a comprehensive solution to address these evolving transportation needs by creating a digital marketplace that connects bike owners with individuals seeking short-term rental services. The platform leverages modern web technologies to provide a seamless, secure, and user-friendly experience for all stakeholders involved in the bike rental ecosystem.

The system is designed as a multi-tenant platform supporting three distinct user roles:

**Customers:** Individuals seeking to rent bikes for personal transportation, recreational activities, or temporary mobility needs. The platform provides them with access to a diverse fleet of vehicles, transparent pricing, secure booking mechanisms, and integrated payment processing.

**Owners:** Bike owners looking to monetize their idle vehicles by listing them for rental. The platform offers comprehensive tools for vehicle management, pricing optimization, booking oversight, and earnings tracking.

**Administrators:** Platform managers responsible for maintaining system integrity, user verification, content moderation, and overall platform governance.

The RentRider platform addresses several critical challenges in the traditional bike rental industry, including limited vehicle availability, lack of transparency in pricing, cumbersome booking processes, security concerns, and inadequate customer support mechanisms.

## 1.2 Problem Definition

The traditional bike rental industry faces numerous challenges that hinder its growth and limit customer satisfaction:

### 1.2.1 Limited Accessibility and Availability
