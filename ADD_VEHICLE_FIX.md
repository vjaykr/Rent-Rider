## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Server-Side Changes**

#### 1. **Image Upload Middleware**
```javascript
// middleware/upload.js
const multer = require('multer');
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: './uploads/vehicles/',
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    const uniqueSuffix = Date.now() + '-' + Math.round(Math.random() * 1E9);
    cb(null, file.fieldname + '-' + uniqueSuffix + path.extname(file.originalname));
  }
});
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Vehicle Controller**
```javascript
// Handles both JSON and FormData
const isFormData = req.headers['content-type']?.includes('multipart/form-data');
// Proper data parsing and validation
// Image URL generation for uploaded files
```

#### 3. **Static File Serving**
```javascript
// server.js
app.use('/uploads', express.static('uploads'));
```

### **Client-Side Changes**

#### 1. **FormData Submission**
```javascript
const formDataToSend = new FormData();
formDataToSend.append('name', formData.name);
// ... other fields
formData.images.forEach(image => {
  formDataToSend.append('images', image);
});
```

#### 2. **Image Upload Interface**
- Multiple file selection
- Image preview functionality
- Progress indication

## 📊 **VERIFICATION**

```bash
# Test vehicle addition
POST /api/vehicles
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

# Verify public visibility
GET /api/vehicles
# Should return newly added vehicles

# Check image serving
GET /uploads/vehicles/[image-filename]
# Should serve uploaded images
```
