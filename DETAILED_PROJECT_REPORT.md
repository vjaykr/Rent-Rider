## ABSTRACT

The RentRider project is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to revolutionize the bike rental industry by creating a seamless digital marketplace connecting bike owners with customers. The platform addresses the growing demand for sustainable transportation solutions while providing economic opportunities for vehicle owners.

The system implements a multi-role architecture supporting three distinct user types: customers seeking rental services, owners wanting to monetize their vehicles, and administrators managing the platform. Built using modern web technologies including React.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data persistence, the platform ensures scalability, security, and optimal user experience.

Key features include secure authentication with Google OAuth integration, real-time booking management, integrated payment processing via Razorpay, comprehensive admin dashboard, mobile-responsive design, and advanced search capabilities with location-based filtering. The system implements robust security measures including JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, data validation, and secure file upload mechanisms.

The project demonstrates practical application of modern software engineering principles, including RESTful API design, database optimization, responsive web design, and third-party service integration. Performance optimizations such as lazy loading, code splitting, and database indexing ensure efficient operation under varying load conditions.
