# Vehicle System Fixes - Complete Implementation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Logout Issue When Clicking "My Vehicles"**
- **Problem**: Users were getting logged out when accessing owner vehicle routes
- **Root Cause**: Navigation was pointing to protected routes without proper role checking
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed navigation routes in `Navigation.js`
  - Updated `ProtectedRoute.js` to handle role-based access properly
  - Added proper error handling for unauthorized access

### 2. **Database Integration for Vehicle System**
- **Problem**: Vehicle system was using localStorage instead of database
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `vehicleService.js` to use proper API endpoints
  - Made vehicle listing public (no authentication required)
  - Implemented proper CRUD operations for owners
  - Added fallback data for offline/error scenarios

### 3. **Public Vehicle Display on Home Page**
- **Problem**: Vehicles were not visible without login
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `Home.js` to display featured vehicles from database
  - Made vehicle search completely public
  - Added loading states and error handling
  - Vehicles now visible to all users without authentication

### 4. **Role-Based Access Control**
- **Problem**: Inconsistent role-based permissions
- **Solution**:
  - Updated server routes to properly handle public vs protected endpoints
  - Fixed middleware to allow public vehicle viewing
  - Implemented proper owner-only access for vehicle management
  - Added clear error messages for unauthorized access
